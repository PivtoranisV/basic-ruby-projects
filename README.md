## Overview
This repository contains solutions to classic “intro to programming” problems, aimed at solidifying my Ruby knowledge and familiarizing me with small project-based development.

## Projects:

### 1. Caesar Cipher

**Task:** Implement a Caesar cipher that takes in a string and a shift factor, then outputs the modified string.  
**Purpose:** This project demonstrates an understanding of basic string manipulation and encryption techniques.

### 2. Sub Strings

**Task:** Implement a method #substrings that takes a word and an array of valid substrings (dictionary). The method should return a hash listing each substring (case-insensitive) found in the word, and the count of occurrences.  
**Purpose:** This project focuses on string searching, array manipulation, and hash mapping in Ruby.

### 3. Stock Picker

**Task:** Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices (one per day) and returns the best pair of days to buy and sell for the maximum profit. Days are indexed from 0.  
**Purpose:** This project helps practice logic for determining optimal buy/sell pairs using arrays and loop iterations.

### 4. Bubble Sort

**Task:** Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns it sorted using the bubble sort algorithm.  
**Purpose:** This project is an introduction to sorting algorithms and implementing them manually in Ruby without using built-in sorting methods.
